                Can you imagine the amount of money you might have accumulated
                if you had begun to invest wisely in your teens? Although you
                cannot turn back the clock, you can promote investment in the
                mind of your teenager. Investment in the stock market is a good
                idea, and though it involves some calculated risks, you can
                still earn profits. Teenagers need to know how to invest in
                assets, and do it prudently so they can develop their net worth
                as they get older.

              <p>
                Learning about how the stock market works and understanding how
                to invest for your future is also a smart financial decision.
                The earlier you start, the more money you’re likely to have to
                meet your financial goals, like perhaps saving for college,
                buying a home, and retirement. Now teens, don’t check out on me
                just because some of these things seem like they’re a long way
                off. Believe it or not, planning for the future starts right now

              <p>
                It’s important to educate yourself about the different kinds of
                investment products (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) and the
                benefits and risks involved with each. Know that a diversified
                investment portfolio with a mix of different kinds of products,
                can help spread the risk during the ups and downs of the market.
                When creating an investment plan, stick with it and plan for the
                long-term. Remember to set aside some funds for a rainy day. Be
                aware of online scams. If the investment opportunity sounds too
                good to be true, it probably is.

                Opening an Investment Account for Teens 
              </h5>
              <p>
                If your child is under 18 years old, the most effective way to
                start investing for or with them is to open a custodial account.
                With this type of account, an adult “custodian” opens an account
                and can save and invest money on behalf of the child. Then, when
                the child reaches adulthood—either 18 or 21, depending on the
                state—they’ll take full control of the account.

                the enterprising teen. Their pocket money is helping fuel

                billion (Rs49,189 crore) in May from just $923 million a year
                earlier. Drawn by the promise of huge profits and looking for
                ways to beat pandemic boredom, kids are buying bitcoin and other
                tokens—and quickly getting acquainted with market ups and downs.

                    where to trade, with a slew of exchanges actively courting
                    them. Platforms such as WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch
                    Kuber have launched social media campaigns to get more
                    investors on board, and created apps with user-friendly
                    interfaces. Their staff interact with customers on Twitter
                    on a daily basis, and are quick to address glitches.
                    Separately, these trading platforms are lobbying authorities
                    on the benefits of blockchain technology and virtual tokens.

                    While the Supreme Court’s decision to quash the restrictions
                    on banks dealing with cryptocurrency entities has been a
                    telling sign that authorities are not completely against
                    digital tokens or blockchain technology, many young
                    investors are bracing for potential restrictions. They cite
                    the lack of proper regulations in India as a deterrent in
                    the country’s path to adopting digital tokens for wider use.
                    The Indian Parliament is currently working on a
                    cryptocurrency bill, though it’s still unclear when it will
                    be heard or what its contents will be.

                  Blue-chip stocks are stocks of the biggest companies in the
                  country. They are usually the stocks of high quality companies
                  with years of strong profit and steady dividend payments. They

                  Growth stocks are stocks of companies with profits that are
                  increasing quickly. This increase in profits is reflected in
                  the rise in the company's stock price. The definition of the
                  level of profit growth that determines whether a stock is a
                  growth stock varies from time to time.

                  Income stocks are the stocks of stable companies that pay

                  in these stable income companies since it provides them with a
                  steady income--more than they can earn by investing in bonds
                  or putting their money in savings accounts.

                  Cyclical stocks are stocks in companies whose fortunes go up
                  and down with the business cycle. Stock prices of these
                  companies go up when general business conditions are good and
                  the prices go down when general business conditions are bad.

                  Interest-rate sensitive stocks are stocks that are affected
                  primarily by changes in interest rates. Banks and other
                  financial companies can be considered interest-rate sensitive
                  companies. These companies feel the effects of any move by the
                  Federal Reserve to hold off inflation or to kick-start the
                  economy.

                <p>
                  A defensive stock is a stock that provides consistent
                  dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the
                  overall stock market. There is a constant demand for their
                  products, so defensive stocks tend to be more stable during
                  the various phases of the business cycle.

              charge, so it is important to know what you are purchasing and how
              much it costs.

              Don’t be greedy. Set yourself a stop gains to collect all returns
              that you made. Same goes for losses, make sure you have a stop
              loss to protect yourself.

              Don’t succumb to Fomo. One for all is not the chant for investing.
              One must trade what they know of fundamentally and nothing more.

              Patience is key. It is important to teach teenagers that investing
              is a game of patience and is about the long-term view.

              Dive in to learn, not to solely earn. Teenagers must continue to
              learn about what they find curious, while copying trades may make
              them money once but will not always work.

              Teenage traders can start very small, dip their toes into the
              market and learn from very small mistakes on how to properly build
              their wealth.

              <p>
                A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors
                and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and
                short-term debt. The combined holdings of the mutual fund are
                known as its portfolio. Investors buy shares in mutual funds.
                Each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund
                and the income it generates.

              <p>
                Money market funds have relatively low risks, compared with
                other mutual funds. They are limited by law to certain
                high-quality, short-term investments. Investor losses on money
                market funds have been rare, but they are possible.

              <h5 class="p-3 font-weight-bold">Bond Funds</h5>
              <p>
                Bond funds (also called fixed income funds) have higher risks
                than money market funds, but seek to pay higher returns. Unlike
                money market funds, bond funds are not restricted to
                high-quality or short-term investments. Because there are many
                different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically in
                their risks and rewards.

              <h5 class="p-3 font-weight-bold">Stock Funds</h5>
              <p>
                Stock funds (also called equity funds) generally involve more
                risk than money market or bond funds, but they also can offer
                the highest returns (or the highest profit). A stock fund’s
                value (NAV) can rise and fall quickly over the short term, but
                historically stocks have performed better over the long term
                than other types of investments.
